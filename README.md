Clustering of the mass-radius relation for extrasolar and solar system planets.

## Introduction
As of this writing, astronomers have discovered 4,364 planets orbiting other stars. Known as extrasolar planets, or exoplanets for short, these bodies display a wide variety of features. Two of these features, mass and radius, are fundamental quantities that, taken together, convey information about a planet's internal composition. A scatter plot of mass and radii for confirmed exoplanets looks like this
